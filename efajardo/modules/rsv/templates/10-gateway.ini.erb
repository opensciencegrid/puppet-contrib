[Gateway]
; This section has settings for selecting and configuring the daemon
; on your CE that sends jobs to other job managers on your CE,
; called the job gateway (or just gateway). This is either the
; Globus GRAM Gatekeeper (from the globus-gatekeeper package) or
; HTCondor-CE (from the htcondor-ce package).
;
; In addition to enabling the gateways on a CE, these settings are
; used to tell other services, such as the various job managers and
; RSV, which gateways are being used.
;
; Both the GRAM Gatekeeper and HTCondor-CE may be installed
; alongside each other. If both are enabled then GRAM will be
; preferred.

; This setting configures the services that use the gateway to use
; the Globus GRAM Gatekeeper. The following things will happen if
; this is set to True:
;   - RSV will be configured to use GRAM (via Condor-G) to run
;     remote probes.
;   - RSV will be configured to run probes that test the
;     functionality of globus-gatekeeper.
;   - GRAM will be configured to work with the job managers that are
;     enabled in the other config files.
gram_gateway_enabled = <%= @gram_gateway_enabled %>

; This setting configures the services that use the gateway to
; use HTCondor-CE. The following things will happen if this is
; set to True:
;   - RSV will be configured to use HTCondor-CE (via Condor-G) to
;     run remote probes (only if gram_gateway_enabled is False).
;   - RSV will be configured to run probes that test the
;     functionality of condor-ce.
;   - HTCondor-CE will be configured to work with the job managers
;     that are enabled in the other config files.
